# Code Refactor Starter Code
This website was refactored to optimize for accessibility and SEO. Alt-text was added to each of the images, providing a description for screen readers to interpret the page, and semantic elements were added in place of generic "div" elements. This provides better readability for SEO and a clearer structure for certain accessibility tools.
Furthermore, the CSS was commented out and cleaned to be more coherent for future passes of the code.
